# BASIC SCHEDULING EXAMPLE

This example demonstrates how to use the automatic university scheduler to schedule a set of courses for a set of students.

It uses 3 scripts:

1. `preprocess_courses.py`: this script will create directory structure and check the integrity of the course models.
2. `extract_existing_constraints.py`: this script will extract the existing constraints from the scheduling database of the university.
3. `schedule_courses.py`: this script will schedule the courses.
